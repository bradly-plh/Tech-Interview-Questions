# Tech-Interview-Questions

This is where I am practicing interview questions for both Python and SQL.

1) Checking for Dublicates.ipynb
    Make a function that will take in a list and return a list of any dublicates.

2) Print Numbers.ipynb
      Write a program to generate and print a list of numbers from 1 to 10.

3) Square Numbers.ipynb
      Write a function to create and print a list where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 30.
